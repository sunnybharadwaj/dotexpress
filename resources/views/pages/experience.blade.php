                                    Children are full of dreams and aspirations.  This workshop will bring them one step closer to their dreams by helping them visualize success.  As Marian Edelman rightly said, "you can't be what you can't see."  We start with a short quiz and discussion on role models, who do the children look up to and what specific traits and achievements they admire about their role models.  This will be followed by an exercise where the children imagine themselves to be on the cover of a magazine and draw out what it would look like.  They have to think about the Title of the magazine, tag lines that would be on the cover page and a short paragraph for the cover story.  What would it say about them? What would the cover story describe?</p>

                                    Ikigai is a Japanese concept that focuses on discovering your "reason for being".  In this workshop, we will start with a brief discussion on the concept of Ikigai and through a set of structured questions help children learn the difference between passion, skills and ultimately getting paid for what they do. This will be followed by an exercise on identifying what kind of problems she/he would want to solve when they grow-up. We will break the children into groups based on similar interests and help them delve deeper into the problem and the knowledge/expertise required to solve that particular problem.  We hope this workshop will help the participants discover their vocation. This framework can also be used whenever they are at crossroads in life.
